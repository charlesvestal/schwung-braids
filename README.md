# Braids for Move Everything

Macro oscillator module based on [Mutable Instruments Braids](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack) by Emilie Gillet.

47 synthesis algorithms covering analog waveforms, FM, physical modeling, noise, and more.

## Features

- 47 synthesis engines (CSAW, FM, PLUK, BELL, DRUM, etc.)
- 4-voice polyphony with voice stealing
- AR envelope and SVF filter per voice
- Preset browser
- Works standalone or as a sound generator in Signal Chain patches

## Prerequisites

- [Move Everything](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything) installed on your Ableton Move
- SSH access enabled: http://move.local/development/ssh

## Install

### Via Module Store (Recommended)

1. Launch Move Everything on your Move
2. Select **Module Store** from the main menu
3. Navigate to **Sound Generators** > **Braids**
4. Select **Install**

### Build from Source

Requires Docker (recommended) or ARM64 cross-compiler.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-everything-braids
cd move-anything-braids
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```
